# Introduction to Statistical Data Analysis and Visualization with Python ISDAwPython_day2

This repository contains the course material for the second day of the course "Introduction to Statistical Data Analysis and Visualization with Python" given at Bern University by the Science IT Support unit in the frame of the [Transferable Skills](https://www.unibe.ch/forschung/nachwuchsfoerderung/ts/ts/ressource_veranstaltungen/fs21/python_fs21/python_fs21/index_ger.html#pane1014835) program of Bern University's Vice-Rectorate for Development.

## Content

After a first session covering the basics of Python and programming, this second lecture focuses on the core Python packages used for scientific computation and data science: Numpy and Pandas. Given the time-constraint, the course attempts to give an overview of essential concepts and data structures in these packages, so that participants have an entry-point in the Python scientific software stack.

## Interactive material

All the course material is offered in the form of interactive notebooks that can be executed via Jupyter or its Google equivalent Colab. As Colab doesn't require any installation, participants are expected to run their notebooks from there, and no support is provided *during* the course for local Jupyter installations. Participants who try a local installation and encounter problems are welcome to contact the course organizers.

You can open the notebooks in Colab directly by clicking on the badge at the top left of this page. Beware that you should **save a copy to your Google Drive** if you want to preserve your changes.
